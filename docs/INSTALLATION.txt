   - Create project at console.firebase.google.com
   - Add Web App; enable Authentication providers: Email/Password, Google, Anonymous
   - Create Firestore (test mode for dev)
   - (Storage optional; this app stores images in Firestore as compressed data for free plan limits)

   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...

Usage:
- Sign up as Donor or Receiver (role is permanent)
- Donor: Create Post (image compressed to Firestore), location auto/manual, view Food Requests, Accept/Reject (shares donor phone on accept)
- Receiver: Browse map/list, filter veg/non‑veg and distance, Request food, track in My Requests; notifications on accept/reject

Notes:
- Free plan limits: images are compressed and stored as data URLs in Firestore; keep images small (<900KB after compression)
- Geolocation/Notifications need HTTPS and user permission
